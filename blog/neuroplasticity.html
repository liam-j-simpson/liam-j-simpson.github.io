    <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>
      By understanding neuroplasticity, people can use strategies to improve
      Neuroplasticity in their brain and build strong neural pathways. This
      allows effective learning of new skills or information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time we’ve passed our late twenties, the number of synapses firing
      between the neuron's in our brain have greatly reduced since childhood. A
      synapse is the small gap at the end of a neuron that allows information to
      transfer from one neuron to the next. The process of these reducing is
      called ‘Synaptic pruning’. The brain strengthens pathways in the brain
      that are used often and eliminates pathways that haven’t aren’t used. This
      is where the saying comes from: ‘neurons that fire together, wire
      together.’ The more we focus on one particular area of learning the
      stronger we can build neural pathways in this area!
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I will use Neuroplasticity to my benefit is by practicing coding
      consistently to create strong neural pathways in this area. I’m also
      concentrating on doing a wider range of exercise at the moment, by taking
      small achievable steps towards my exercise goals I’ll slowly but surely
      create strong neural pathways that allow for more efficient learning
      around exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the more generic ways to increase neuroplasticity in the brain
      are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Getting lots of sleep. Sleep effects dendritic growth. Dendrites help
        with the transmission of information from one nueron to the next. The
        quality of your alertness is dependent on your sleep quality for the
        past two nights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercising often. Exercise can prevent neuron loss in the hippocampus
        (involved holding short term memories and transferring them to short
        term memory)
      </li>
      <li>Doing Mindfulness practices.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some quite unique strategies suggested by Dr. Andrew Huberman are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cyclical breathing: taking 10-15 vigorous breathes will trigger
        alertness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Visual focus exercise: Sit and focus your eyes on one specific location
        in the room, when your eyes start to shift from this location, re set
        your focus on the area again. Doing this for 15 to 60 seconds is
        effective for focus when learning from a book or screen. Your cognitive
        focus follows your visual focus.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generate as many repetitions possible of a particular task in a short
        period of time.The brain recognises this and triggers neural plasticity.
        If you feel hurried, you’re doing it right! This practise will allow you
        to perform the action without even having to try.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expect and embrace errors, these signal to your nervous system that
        something needs to change in your brain. The second repetition of a task
        after an error will be far more effective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Micro-rest intervals: random breaks where we stop doing the activity for
        10 seconds. Science shows our neurons keep firing but at a 10x faster
        rate. It’s important that these rest occur randomly and for no longer
        than 10 seconds.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      One resource that I found particularly engaging about Neuroplasticity was:
      Dr Huberman on the Neuroplasticity super protocol:

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>
      Based on our upbringing and life experiences we all carry a belief about
      our abilities and this belief can fit into one of two categories, Fixed or
      Growth. An individual with a fixed mindset doesn’t believe they can change
      their abilities, personality, relationships or lifestyle etc. They believe
      that what has been cemented in the past, such as their intelligence, is
      rigidly in place. This causes issues for these people as they go
      throughout life. A person with a fixed mindset can be easily identified
      through five key symptoms:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How they approach challenges. A fixed mindset will avoid challenges,
        while a growth mindset will embrace them.
      </li>
      <li>
        How they work through obstacles. A fixed mindset will give up easily, a
        growth mindset will employ persistence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their perception of effort. A fixed mindset will see effort as pointless
        when their mind ‘doesn’t have the natural ability to achieve the
        challenge set out.’ A growth mindset will see all effort as a stepping
        stone on the journey to mastery.
      </li>
      <li>
        How they react to criticism. A fixed mindset will disregard constructive
        criticism and will take it as a personal attack on their own
        intelligence. A growth mindset will learn from criticism.
      </li>
      <li>
        How they feel about the success of others. A fixed mindset will feel
        threatened by the success of others. A growth mindset will find
        inspiration and will learn lessons through the success of others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They study of adopting a growth mindset when learning to code is relevant
      as it’s a very difficult thing to learn. If an individual was to tackle
      the task of becoming a programmer while avoiding challenges, giving up in
      the face of obstacles, seeing their effort as pointless, reacting
      negatively to criticism and feeling threatened by the success of others…
      their success would be minimised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something that surprised me was that I identified areas in my own life
      where I have a fixed mindset. I’ve always had the belief that mindset is
      everything and that we can achieve anything if we employ an open or growth
      mindset. However, through my time working in the marketing industry these
      highly optimistic views were destroyed. If you’re in a toxic work
      environment that doesn’t support you, no matter how much you embrace
      challenges, persist through obstacles and take on criticism as opportunity
      to learn and be inspired, you’ll eventually feel like your efforts are
      fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading these articles has allowed me to regain my optimism and growth
      mindset that I didn’t know I’d long lost. What a life changing Monday
      morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll be using a growth mindset in my own learning journey by following the
      small mantra I’ve written below. I’ve written this on a piece of paper
      near my desk so I can consistently move my mind toward a growth mindset.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth Mindset Mantra</h3>
    <p>
      Run towards challenges.<br />
      Persist through set backs.<br />
      All effort is a worthy investment.<br />
      Welcome criticism and learn from it.<br />
      Celebrate the success of others and take inspiration from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would also be interesting to see whether this kind of mantra can be
      combined with my mindfulness practises to create new neural pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Resource that I found particularly useful during this research phase
      was: https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Plan + New Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Understanding fixed and growth mindsets has helped me understand the
      difference between someone who thinks and behaves in a way that leads to
      success and someone who doesn’t. I now have a framework for checking up on
      myself so I can make sure that I’m operating with a growth mindset.<br />
      Understanding neuroplasticity has given me practical strategies for how I
      can trigger my brain into a learning state, and daily habits I can do to
      make sure my new learnings are solidifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key change ’d like to make to my learning plan is the addition of three
      daily habits: getting 8hrs of sleep, 1hr of exercise and 30min of
      mindfulness per day. I’d also like to add neuroplasticity strategies as
      and when they are needed throughout the day: cyclical breathing, visual
      focus exercises, repetitions, embracing errors and using random micro rest
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel like I’ve discovered some really great learnings in this section.
