    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
        I prefer to learn through doing things. I’d much rather work on a challenge and learn along the way than read books and watch videos to fill my brain with information.  
        </li>
        <li>
        I learnt that maybe I don’t have as much of a growth mindset as I thought I did! I’d always considered myself a keen learner but I think some of my mindsets had shifted over the years of working in the creative industry leading to me adopting some fixed mindset issues. This was quite jarring to realise, but cool to be able to work towards more free, open mindsets. I think these new ideas I’ve taken onboard will make me much better to work alongside.
        </li>
        <li>
        Something I learnt about my ego is that I can be quite precious about how I’m perceived. One of the fixed mindsets traits is to not be open to criticism and tbh… I think I’ve slipped into this one. I can be quite sensitive when it comes to what others think about my work which means I’m not always open to constructive criticism. This was really good to become aware of and is something that I’ve been working on since in my personal life and coding. 
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Learning programming is something that is very difficult to do so it requires us to bring our all to the challenge. There’s going to be times where we’re tired or have to make difficult decisions and how we navigate these decisions and work with others is wholly based on who we are, what our values are and our emotional intelligence (ability to empathise and have self awareness). It’s important we understand where we sit within each of these areas and what our impact is on the people around us as we’ll be working closely with others.  
    </p>

    <h3>
      What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was surprised how much I learnt about myself. The pros and cons of my personality traits, how my ego can get in the way of things and whether I have a fixed or growth mindset. Learning about myself so thoroughly has given me a good insight into areas for growth. I was also surprised about how holistic the whole Human Skills experience was, being consistently told to be kind to myself while learning coding, learning mindfulness practices and being encouraged to reflect on each area of learning as I went to really cement the concepts. The Human Skills section of this course really showed that this isn’t your ordinary programming bootcamp.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenging aspects were digging deep and being honest with myself when reflecting on concepts such as ego, emotional intelligence and fixed vs growth mindsets. Another area that was challenging was adopting strategies or practises that were outside of my usual such as meditation, or sitting back and evaluating a problem / planning before tackling it. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>It must be something that the industry is crying out for. If there’s such a big push on learning these skills during bootcamp I’d imagine that there’s a lot of interpersonal issues within teams in the tech industry and issues with individuals not knowing how to manage stress and burnout. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>No it doesn’t feel like a waste of time. My meditation that I did before each day of learning programming allowed me to focus. That strong focus in itself is worth the couple of hours a week spent on Human Skills.</p>
