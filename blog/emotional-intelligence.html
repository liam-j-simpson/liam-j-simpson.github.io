    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is the ability to healthily navigate interpersonal
      relationships using emotions. There’s four sub skills within the over
      arching topic of Emotional Intelligence, these are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Perceiving emotions: Accurately reading verbal and non verbal queues to
        understand your own or other’s emotions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reasoning with emotions: Allowing your emotions to stimulate cognitive
        thoughts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understanding emotions: Searching for understanding of these emotions.
        E.g. what’s the source of this persons anger? Are they angry at me or is
        these something external to our relationship that has caused this anger?
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing emotions: Controlling how we healthily respond to our emotions
        or the emotions of others.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ is the ‘soft skills’ intelligence that we carry. EQ is commonly shown
      by how well we work with people. IQ is the more generic intelligence or
      ‘hard skills’. IQ is commonly shown through how proficient we are at
      learning new concepts, new skills, recalling information and solving
      problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>
      Working in a group allows us to achieve more than we ever could as an
      individual, that’s why organisations exist. However, working in a group is
      complex. Humans aren’t as black and white as code on a screen. Each person
      brings a myriad of emotions, values and beliefs to a team and to navigate
      these complexities is a skill. This skill is what we call EQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      EQ is needed for a group to understand each other’s emotions and to relate
      to each other. Without EQ, team’s can’t reach their full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common issue in the workforce is that employees can have amazing IQ
      however, their EQ is lacking. EQ is critical to working within a team and
      therefore, is often of higher priority than IQ in the workplace. As the
      saying goes, “you can train skills but you can’t train personality.”
    </p>
    <h3>When will you commit to practicing Mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
      When I’m having breakfast and a coffee in the morning. I'm committing to
      doing 10min of meditation initially and I'll increase the time as I
      practise mindfulness further.
