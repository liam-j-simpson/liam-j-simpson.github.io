    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

    <p>
      The values that are the most important to me are values of optimism,
      making the most of ones time, working hard and socialising with others.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had a client request some content from a video production that
          framed them in a light that was untrue. It was a difficult request to
          receive, on one side I wanted to go above and beyond for my client by
          providing them with what they were after but on the other side I
          couldn’t give them content that was going to portray a message that
          was untrue. Truth and integrity is a big value for me so I explained
          to the client that I wouldn’t supply the content and gave them the
          reason. Reflecting on this decision I honestly think the client was a
          bit shocked by the pushback but I think it was the right decision to
          make at the time and I’m glad I stuck to my values.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I was raised in New Zealand with a mum and dad, both NZ / European.
          They raised me and my two sisters to value exploring NZ’s natural
          landscape through frequent camping trips and the occasional hike
          together. This value for New Zealand’s natural landscape is what
          continues to be a large part of my identity. Kiwi culture can come
          with some other influences and cultural norms. It’s common for kiwis
          to steer clear of discussing their feelings with each other and this
          is something that I definitely subscribed to in the past. The effects
          of this is something that I became aware of in my 20’s through seeing
          people’s struggles with mental health. It took witnessing these
          detrimental effects for me to re-evaluate my identity and what areas
          of ‘culture’ I am influenced by. I’ve worked in the creative industry
          for six years now as a photographer and have been influenced by
          creatives of different disciplines around me. This has led me to have
          an appreciation and strong value for architecture, design and just
          generally the beauty of everyday things. Through being around a group
          of friends with good emotional intelligence I’ve taken an interest in
          mental health and in particular the healthy use of technology. Social
          media use is one of my favourite topics and I’m intrigued to see
          whether social media can become truly social and built for the benefit
          of the customer.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>
          My top five strengths based on the Clifton strength finders are:
          activator, empathy, futuristic, strategic and woo. My strengths in
          empathy and woo will support me in the human skills section of the
          course. I really enjoy relating to others and find that I work with
          people well. My activator strength is great for turning ideas into
          action and strategic means that I like to look at things from
          different perspectives before choosing a unique path to a solution,
          this will be quite usefull for problem solving.

        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Being an activator isn’t always helpful for things like coding! I love
          to dive straight into solving problems with less thought for planning
          and this could be an issue when it comes to problem solving with
          coding. I’ll need to make sure I plan effectively before getting into
          the nitty gritty.

        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had a video shoot that I was directing where the output was films
          about environmental sustainability. The production team I was working
          with had some tension at the time and I needed to get them onboard
          with the research and scriptwriting I had done. My strategy for
          overcoming the tension was making sure that each individual on the
          team felt empowered within their role and had clear instruction on
          what they needed to achieve to make the production successful.
          Throughout the project I checked in with each team member to make sure
          they were happy with the process. If I was to do this again I would
          discuss the tension directly with the team. In the past I’ve had a
          less direct approach, making each team member feel valued individually
          rather than consulting the issues of the team upfront with the group.
