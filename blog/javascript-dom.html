    <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
    <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
      It’s week 3 of the DevAcademy foundations course and we’ve taken a dive
      into the world of JavaScript. In the following paragraphs I’m going to
      explain what JavaScript is, and the fundamentals we’ve learnt so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming language that works in relationship with HTML
      and CSS. To explain this relationship I’m going to use the analogy of a
      Bicycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for a Bicycle to be built there needs to be a blueprint showing
      the parts list and the structure of how these parts are put together
      (HTML). These parts aren’t all the same! They each have their own unique
      attributes that allow them to do a specific job or have a particular
      aesthetic (CSS). These attributes could be the paint colour, the parts
      material or it’s size. Once we’ve assembled the bike, there has to be a
      form of interaction between these parts for the bike to move (JavaScript).
    </p>
    <p>
      As illustrated above, HTML provides the elements of a website and the
      structure of the page. CSS gives unique attributes and styling to each of
      these elements. JavaScript determines how these elements interact with
      each other and what causes them to interact (the trigger).
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that we have an illustration of Javascipts relationship with HTML and
      CSS I’ll go further into the details of the Javascript fundamentals we’ve
      learnt this week.
    </p>
    <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you’re going to the supermarket to buy groceries for cooking a
      late night cook up. There’s several steps that need to occur for this to
      happen:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a shopping list.</li>
      <li>Get in the car.</li>
      <li>Drive to the supermarket.</li>
      <li>Walk through the supermarket picking up the needed ingredients.</li>
      <li>Go to the check-out and purchase the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Drive home.</li>
      <li>Get cooking.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These steps can’t be completed out of order. We can’t check-out before
      selecting our products and we can’t make our meal before driving home.
      There’s a set order for these steps to be followed and if this order isn’t
      followed we won’t be able to make our glorious meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      This order is called the control flow. When Javascript files are read
      they’re read from the first line to the last line in sequential order.
      There are however, some structures that change the control flow. Loops are
      a structure that changes the control flow. Lets continue using the example
      of a supermarket to illustrate loops.
    </p>
    <p>When you arrive at the checkout the cashier performs a loop. They:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grab the nearest product on the conveyor belt.</li>
      <li>Scan the product.</li>
      <li>Place the product in a paper bag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And they continue to do this loop until they reach the total number of
      products selected. This loop would be presented in code like:
    </p>

    <p class="code-block">
      for(i = 0; i < productOrder.length; i++)
      <br />{ grab product <br />scan product <br />place product in bag}
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the loop is completed, the cashier is able to move on to the next
      steps of their code:
      <ol>
        <li>Saying would you like a receipt? (Good example of a
          boolean)</li>
        <li>Saying thank-you, have a nice day.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>The DOM</h3>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS and JS are held together by the Document Object Model (DOM). The
      DOM creates a tree view of the objects that represent our entire html
      document. These objects are known as nodes and can be anything from a div
      or head tag through to CSS .classes and #IDs. As we know, JavaScript is an
      object based language and these objects in the node tree are exactly that,
      JavaScript objects! The DOM is in fact an exact replica of our HTML
      document but in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the DOM gives us access to every part of our HTML document through
      the use of JS objects, we have the ability to create, change or remove
      objects or properties, pretty awesome! So if we wanted to add a new
      property to a JS object we could do this through finding the object with a
      query and then manipulating it by assigning a new value.
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays & Objects</h3>
    <p>
      In JavaScript Arrays and Objects are used to store data. Objects store
      data within ‘keys’ (which basically look like sub-headings below the
      object title) while Arrays store data that’s indexed inline, numbering
      from 0 upwards. Below is an example of an array and an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because these two methods store data in a completely different way, they
      access it in a completely different way too. When grabbing data from an
      object we use the object.key notation which is really quite logical. From
      there we can use the data, modify it or remove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An array is slightly different as data is stored in an index numbering
      from 0. When we want to access the data from an array we use the
      arrayname[0] notation (within the square brackets we enter the number
      index we want). From there we can manipulate the data, remove it and use
      it.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Functions are made up of multiple lines of code and are created to perform
      a particular task. They are triggered either automatically (on page load)
      or through an event (such as a button click).
    </p>
    <p>Functions have three key areas to their syntax/ structure.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The first line uses the function keyword followed by a unique name and
        then parameters (if applicable) within round brackets.
      </li>

      <li>
        Within the curly brackets the actionable lines of code are written (what
        the function actually does).
      </li>

      <li>
        Outside of the curly brackets the function is called using it’s name and
        the standard brackets. Within these brackets arguments can be written,
        these arguments are passed into the function.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Functions are helpful because they are repeatable, meaning you can use a
      function multiple times throughout a project without having to rewrite the
      code. The outcome of a function can change depending on the arguments
      written within the brackets when the function is called. This means that
      there can be multiple different outcomes of the same function, giving them
      even more flexibility and repeatability.
