        <h3>A Time Where I Was Blocked On A Simple Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The problem I got stuck on was the Gradebook challenge. I this challenge we needed to pull data from an array of student names and an array of test scores and then combine these to create a gradebook for a teacher. 
          I started this challenge strong using my pseudo code (writing the steps that I needed to take in plain english before diving into the code) and rubber ducky problem solving techniques (telling an inanimate object what the problem was and how I was going to solve it in order to simplify the problem). 
          I went down a big rabbit hole looking for the perfect JavaScript method online for solving this challenge and in the end got very stuck. I had already reached out to the discord group for a few of the previous challenges so this time I thought I'd try something different and reached out to a friend who's a software developer.
          My friend was awesome at helping me without giving me the answers, he explained that Javascript methods are really just a function that's been created for you and if you need somethig more specific you can always create your own function. This fact, among others, really helped me with this challenge and the following challenges too.
          When I was stuck I felt pretty overwhelmed, I could see that I was getting behind the group by a mile and was worried about that. Once I got the help and saw that my learnings gave me a new understanding for the next challenges ahead I felt much more positive. 
          In this instance I learnt, that sometimes it's a complete change of perspective that's required to solve a problem. I could've looked at JS methods for hours on end to solve this problem, but in the end the simple loop was what solve it for me.  
        </p>

        <h3>A Time Where I Elegantly Solved A Problem</h3>
        <p>
          I found that I elegantly solved the Built-In Methods problem where I needed to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string. I wrote Pseudo code which allowed me to gain some insights. One of these being that I was working with a string and needed to break that string apart into an array before I could do anyting else! I felt quite chuffed throughout the process, I worked through the different steps of the challenge and was stoked when I got all the green ticks, yeow! 
          I learnt from this challenge that breaking your problems down into smaller problems creates clarity and gives you a good starting point. 
        </p>
        <h3>How Confident I Feel Using Each Of The Probleming Solving Techniques</h3>
        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>Pretty confident with this one however, I find my natural instinct is to jump straight into the problem. I definately find things go smoother when I think deeply and work through the pseudo code slowly.</p>
        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <p>Definately confident with this one, it's often my first port of call.</p>
        <h4>Rubber Ducky Method</h4>
        <p>Getting better at this one, it doesn't come naturally as it just seems weird and I haven't found it beneficial yet compared to other methods but hey, I'll keep giving it a go!</p>
        <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
        <p>Getting good with this one, I was really enjoying reading the error messages during the Kata and working through the challenges using them.</p>
        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>I love console.logging! It's something that I only really picked up towards the end of the week. I find it a great way to disect the code and see what's really going on at different points. It's almost like using a voltmetter at different points along a electric circuit, looking for the fault.</p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>Very confident googling, I'm finding resources like Youtube videos, geeksforgeeks webiste and the shecodes website really helpful. I find the MDN and W3 schools a bit annoying, MDN uses complex language that can be hard to understand as a beginner and the W3 can be too surface level and beginner spec for the problems were solving.</p>
        <h4>Asking Your Peers For Help</h4>
        <p>Feeling real confident on this one, I've had good help from my peers at Dev Academy and the session I had with my software developer friend was awesome! 
        <h4>Asking Coaches For Help</h4>
        <p>Moderately confident, it's quite different asking questions out in the open for everyone else to see haha. I don't mind asking lots of questions but sometiems it feels a bit strange if other people on the course don't seem to need any help.</p>
        <h4>Improving Your Process With Reflection</h4>
        <p>To be honest, in this sprint I've just been trying to get through the content so I haven't really reflected near as much as I was doing at the start of the course. I'm confident doing it and I get great results from it. Maybe I'll carve out time for more reflection this week.</p>
        
        <h3>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>
          <p>When I was trying to complete the Gradebook challenge I was very reluctant to reach out and ask for help, I felt like it was an easy problem and that it was silly I needed help with it. I think the main factor that held me back was that I didn't want to be seen to be struggling on what I thought should be an easy problem, next time I'll just reach out early! Saves time struggling and allows for more time moving on and learning the next thing.</p>
