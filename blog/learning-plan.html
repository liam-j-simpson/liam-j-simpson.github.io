    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <br>
  
      <p>
          My long term goal is to create software that reduces society’s impact on the planet. A key area I’d like to focus on is transport. The key question I’d like to answer is: “How can tech, change how people transit in a more environmentally conscious way.” 
      </p>
      <p class="revisions">I'm still keen to do this however, I wouldn't say more core focus is on transport anymore, I'm just intersted in sustainability and tech overall.</p>
      <p>
        I’m aware that this may not be my first placement upon graduating from Dev Academy so I’m keen to get into anywhere that will stretch my coding and creativity skills and allow me to grow towards working in my desired industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The skills that I’d like to build throughout bootcamp to give me the best opportunity at this career path are: 
        <ul>
          <li>Leadership, I enjoy encouraging people and helping a team come together to achieve a goal. I want to build stronger leadership skills so these can be used in industry.</li>
          <li>Welcoming to criticism. I want to encourage constructive criticism of my work and to use this feedback to make improvements to my work. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing emotions. I want to consciously improve how I respond to others feelings. I generally respond kindly to everyone and this great and all, but it means that I don’t always speak my mind when something needs to be addressed. I want to be more aware of the emotions of the group and to respond to others in a way that allows everyone to be heard and good resolutions to be made.
      </p>  
      <p>
        My biggest strengths that I’ll bring to bootcamp are my enthusiasm, people skills and keenness  for working with computers. My biggest limitations will be my time management skills, jumping into problems head first without planning and maybe a bit of shyness when it comes to meeting new people. 
      </p>   
      <p class="revisions">Still need to work on this one, expressing yourself honestly with team members, not just happy all the time.</p>
      <p>
        Something that I know I’ll find difficult at the bootcamp is communicating my feelings when things are getting tough. This could be in resolving conflict or asking for help when I feel inadequate for asking. I can get in my head a bit when situations like this make me feel uncomfortable.
      </p>  
      <p class="revisions">I haven't found it difficult to get help so far, but I could always ask for more. Focus on getting the help you need throughout the rest of bootcamp!</p>
      <p>
        I expect that the bootcamp team will provide help promptly when someones finding a concept difficult to grasp. Help is always better earlier than later so having a team member who’s ready to help as soon as someones falling behind is what I’d expect. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        For myself, I see the 60hr, 9 weeks ahead of me as something that I’m going to absolutely love. The opportunity to fully immerse myself in a new topic is exciting and I feel really privileged to be going into this. 
        My expectation for myself is that I will put my every effort into each day of the bootcamp and allow myself to be fully immersed in the new topics I’m learning. I’m expecting I’m going to absolutely thrive in doing this! <br>I also expect that I’m going to do my best to improve my time management and planning skills throughout this course.

    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>I want to develop software that either:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Helps with transport (metro systems, airports, bus networks, e-bikes,
        cars etc), any system that helps improve the efficiency of transport
        while also reducing the environmental impact would be quite interesting
        to me.
        <p class="revisions">As touched on earlier, focus doesn't have to be on transport. I've got a general interest in sustainabilitya and how that can be improved with tech. Entreprenuership is also another key area of interst for me.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Helps improve industries (such as agriculture or manufacturing).</li>
      <li>
        Is built for a customer in mind and benefits them individually (e.g.
        fitness tracker, ethical social media solution, environmentally focussed
        apps that help individuals or businesses reduce their waste) 
        <br> The long term goal is to take on the role of a product owner,
        someone who understands software and coding yet works in the realm of
        team management and leadership. I love working with people and have
        enjoyed coordinating creative projects in the past. I find that I work
        well encouraging a team towards a goal!
      </li>
    </ol>
<br>
    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with computers and pick up technical concepts easily.<br />
      I’m optimistic, when I hit a wall I keep working at the problem knowing
      that I’ll break through eventually. The limitation of this is that I won’t
      always ask for help quickly so that’s something I’ll need to be
      intentional about during this course. <br />
      I don’t learn well through books or videos. I can be easily distracted
      when listening to a tutorial however, hyper focussed when I work alongside
      the tutorial. I need to practically try out what I’m learning for it to
      stick. <br />
      <p class="revisions">Still finding it difficult to learn through reading and watching videos. Make sure to not get stuck on this, do practicle exercises to improve!</p>
      <p>In the Clifton strengths my top skill is Activator. This skill comes with
      its strengths and limitations. The strength would be that I’m quick to
      initiate a plan, take action and get something off the ground. The flaw of
      this skill is that sometimes I will rush into creating a solution without
      having a solid plan beforehand. If there’s action to be had, I’m there! So
      it takes a lot of discipline to stick to one task right through to the
      end. <br />
      My second highest strengths is Empathy, this means I can generally pick up
      on what other people are feeling. This is great in a group project context
      however, I can over empathise with other’s feelings too.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I generally shy away from conflict. I’d like to develop healthy conflict
      management skills during the course. I often feel the want to take on
      leadership roles but I don’t have the self confidence to do this. I want
      to have the opportunity to develop leadership skills especially since I'm keen to work towards the product owner role. I would like to
      develop stronger empathy and compassion for others throughout the course,
      this is an area of human skills that I do well in but I’m always keen to
      improve in.
      <p class="revisions">I've taken a few opportunities to be a leader so far, but I could definately take on more as we get into the group projects and exercises towards the end of bootcamp.</p>
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
      industry/community representatives. What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you.
      
    </h3>
    <p>
      To manage my workload in this programme a core focus of mine will be
      consciously managing my time. I can sometimes get too emersed in tasks and
      loose track of time. In order for me to deliver on time for my classmates
      and facilitators I’ll plan my time before getting started and then stick
      to the time throughout the task (time box strategy). <br> When things are
      building up and I start to feel stressed I’ll take a break, ask for help
      if I need it and break everything down into smaller problems so I can work
      on one stressor / problem at a time. </p>
      <p class="revisions">Still room to imrove here, stick to those timeboxes and keep using toggl for your out of class study and revision.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you
      will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
      
      <p>If I can’t solve the problem I’m stuck on within 20min and I’ve gone through the steps of checking spelling,
      debugging the code and breaking the problem into smaller chunks. I’ll
      reach out to my classmates and facilitators via Discord or in person during bootcamp.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>Timely support through Discord or in person during the bootcamp. 
      Good advise that gives me insights into
      how things work in industry. Inspiration! I'm keen to be inspired by all the cool stuff you can achieve through software development.</p> 
      <br>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out
      times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have
      whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>I don’t have many commitments, I’ve paused most of them while I’m doing
      this course. I'll be travelling back to Tauranga most weekends to see my girlfriend.</p>
      <p class="revisions">Not going down to Tauranga as much as I had imagined but still making the effort to go every couple of weeks.</p>
