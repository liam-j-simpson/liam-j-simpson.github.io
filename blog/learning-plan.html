    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>I want to develop software that either:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Helps with transport (metro systems, airports, bus networks, e-bikes,
        cars etc), any system that helps improve the efficiency of transport
        while also reducing the environmental impact would be quite interesting
        to me.
      </li>
      <li>Helps improve industries (such as agriculture or manufacturing).</li>
      <li>
        Is built for a customer in mind and benefits them individually (e.g.
        fitness tracker, ethical social media solution, environmentally focussed
        apps that help individuals or businesses reduce their waste) 
        <br> The long term goal is to take on the role of a product owner,
        someone who understands software and coding yet works in the realm of
        team management and leadership. I love working with people and have
        enjoyed coordinating creative projects in the past. I find that I work
        well encouraging a team towards a goal!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with computers and pick up technical concepts easily.<br />
      I’m optimistic, when I hit a wall I keep working at the problem knowing
      that I’ll break through eventually. The limitation of this is that I won’t
      always ask for help quickly so that’s something I’ll need to be
      intentional about during this course. <br />
      I don’t learn well through books or videos. I can be easily distracted
      when listening to a tutorial however, hyper focussed when I work alongside
      the tutorial. I need to practically try out what I’m learning for it to
      stick. <br />
      In the Clifton strengths my top skill is Activator. This skill comes with
      its strengths and limitations. The strength would be that I’m quick to
      initiate a plan, take action and get something off the ground. The flaw of
      this skill is that sometimes I will rush into creating a solution without
      having a solid plan beforehand. If there’s action to be had, I’m there! So
      it takes a lot of discipline to stick to one task right through to the
      end. <br />
      My second highest strengths is Empathy, this means I can generally pick up
      on what other people are feeling. This is great in a group project context
      however, I can over empathise with other’s feelings too.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I generally shy away from conflict. I’d like to develop healthy conflict
      management skills during the course. I often feel the want to take on
      leadership roles but I don’t have the self confidence to do this. I want
      to have the opportunity to develop leadership skills especially since I'm keen to work towards the product owner role. I would like to
      develop stronger empathy and compassion for others throughout the course,
      this is an area of human skills that I do well in but I’m always keen to
      improve in.
    </p>

    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
      industry/community representatives. What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you.
    </h3>
    <p>
      To manage my workload in this programme a core focus of mine will be
      consciously managing my time. I can sometimes get too emersed in tasks and
      loose track of time. In order for me to deliver on time for my classmates
      and facilitators I’ll plan my time before getting started and then stick
      to the time throughout the task (time box strategy). <br> When things are
      building up and I start to feel stressed I’ll take a break, ask for help
      if I need it and break everything down into smaller problems so I can work
      on one stressor / problem at a time. </p>
      <br>
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you
      will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
      
      <p>If I can’t solve the problem I’m stuck on within 20min and I’ve gone through the steps of checking spelling,
      debugging the code and breaking the problem into smaller chunks. I’ll
      reach out to my classmates and facilitators via Discord or in person during bootcamp.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>Timely support through Discord or in person during the bootcamp. 
      Good advise that gives me insights into
      how things work in industry. Inspiration! I'm keen to be inspired by all the cool stuff you can achieve through software development.</p> 
      <br>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out
      times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have
      whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>I don’t have many commitments, I’ve paused most of them while I’m doing
      this course. I'll be travelling back to Tauranga most weekends to see my girlfriend.</p>
